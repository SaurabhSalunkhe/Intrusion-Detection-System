# Intrusion-Detection-System
Intrusion Detection Undergard Final Project 
# Synopsis
This is a very affordable home security alarm which overcomes the limitations of the already existing burlgar alarms and at the same time can be 
manufactured very cheaply.
All bodies radiate heat in the form of infrared which is not visible to human eyes. However, this can be detected by electronic sensors
like PIR sensor. This sensor generates electric charge when exposed to heat  and sends a signal to arduino.
According to level of the infrared in front of sensor, the GSM model sends a SMS and call to the ownner alerting him about the situation.

# How does it work ? 
Please refer paper above to see the necessary hardware and software tools needed for this gadget. 
The above code has to be compiled in Kyle compiler.
